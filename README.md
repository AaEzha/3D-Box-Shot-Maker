# 3D-Box-Shot-Maker
Free tool to generate 3D box shots for your online products. 

## How to use

The tool is online and can be used in [this link](http://ronenness.github.io/3D-Box-Shot-Maker).

If you want to modify the tool or run it locally, you can also clone this repository, install it via "bower install", and serve the entire folder to run it.

When using windows with python you can run "serve.bat" to serve the entire folder.

## Broken on Chrome

Due to recent changes in Chrome saving image will no longer work (you can preview and edit, but clicking on "Save Image" won't do anything). Please use FireFox or Edge instead.
